# AOC2022

My Advent of Code solutions for 2022.

I'm going to be doing these in js this year so I don't get discouraged on the third day again. Maybe I'll actually do some rust after js is done.

This repo includes a script to download the inputs. Just get your session cookie from the site and either write it to the file `token` or set it to the 
env variable `AOC_TOKEN` and run `./download.sh <day>` to download the inputs for the given day.
